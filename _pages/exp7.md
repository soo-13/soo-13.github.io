- Analyzed sales information received from the POS system of a stew restaurant.
- Identified factors that affect sales, such as soju, and found that soju had the greatest impact.
- Recommended events that could promote soju sales.
- I thought that weather might affect sales, but through actual analysis, I found that it did not have a significant impact according to the data from that stew restaurant.
- Extracted stew-related words from Twitter to see which words people use most when talking about stew.
- I suggested when the best time for events would be and whether the restaurant is currently operating well.
