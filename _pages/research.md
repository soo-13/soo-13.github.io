  - excerpt: 'Do you consider your body pose when you pick which photos to post on your social media? While image with human models are frequently used in marketing, the effect of model&#x2019;s body pose remains largely unknown. Drawing from the psychology literature that body pose can make difference in the observers&#x2019; perceptions and responses, this research investigates how model&#x2019;s body pose depicted in an image influences social media engagement. We introduce two body pose-related metrics that can potentially influence consumer behavior -expansiveness and form- using machine learning and estimate their effects on social media engagement through empirical analysis and lab experiment. Interestingly, we find that pose expansiveness (i.e., how much space the pose takes up) and sitting (vs. naturally standing) pose positively affect social media engagement. Our findings indicate that marketers can improve consumer engagement without extra cost by simply altering model pose'
