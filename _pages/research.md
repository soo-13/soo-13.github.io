<span style="font-size: smaller;"> **Abstract** Images possess significant power to convey both information and emotions. However, previous literature on human images on social media has primarily focused on the mere presence of humans or their facial characteristics. Only a few studies have closely examined the human body pose, likely due to its complexity and unstructured nature. In this work, we introduce and quantify three body pose-related metrics: 1&#41; expansiveness (i.e., the space that the body posture takes up), 2&#41; dynamism (i.e., degree of movement), and 3&#41; form (e.g., standing, sitting). Specifically, we propose a novel metric that quantifies expansiveness from body parts information extracted via an advanced computer vision technique. We quantify dynamism and form by leveraging transfer learning and clustering without human intervention. Utilizing a large fashion image database, we demonstrate how the proposed metrics systematically relate to each other and impact social media engagement proxied by accrued likes. We find that all three metrics have significant and robust main effects on social media engagement. Managerially, the results demonstrate how visual content generators can increase social media engagement by manipulating a model’s pose.</span>
