  - excerpt: 'Do you consider your body pose when selecting photos for your social media posts? While image with human models are frequently used in marketing, the effect of model&#x2019;s body pose remains largely unknown. Drawing from the psychology literature, which suggests that body pose can influence observers&#x2019; perceptions and responses, this research investigates how a model&#x2019;s body pose depicted in an image affects social media engagement. We introduce two body pose-related metrics - expansiveness and form - using machine learning and estimate their effects on social media engagement through empirical analysis and a lab experiment. We find that pose expansiveness (i.e., how much space the pose takes up) and sitting (vs. naturally standing) pose have positive effects on social media engagement. Our findings suggest that marketers can enhance consumer engagement without extra cost by simply adjusting model's pose'

  - excerpt: 'Have you visited a store at a regular opening hours, only to find out that they are temporarily closed? Have you ever waited in a long line in front of a restaurant, only to find out that they are out of ingredients? Most retailers strive to create the best consumer experience and meet consumer demand. Some retailers, however, purposefully create uncertainty in product unavailability and make uvailability information unpredictable for customers prior to their visits (which we term <q> unpredictable marketing</q>). This research project seeks explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior of retailers. Through analytical modeling, we find that unpredictable marketing can signal good quality when product availability is neither too high nor too low and search cost sufficiently low. Specifically, it is better-off for high-quality firm to credibly signal good quality at the cost of losing some demand because consumers value high-quality product and many customers will still want to buy despite the unpredictability. The low-quality firm, on the other hand, cannot mimic this strategy since few customers would risk unpredictability for the low-quality good. Our findings provides explanation on marketing strategy in reality and show under which condition it is successful.'
