  Do you consider your body pose when selecting photos for your social media posts? You might want to, as we've discovered that body pose significantly impacts social media engagment. While images featuring human models are frequently used in marketing, the influence of a model's body pose remains largely unexplored. Drawing upon insights from psychology literature, which suggest that body pose can shape observers' perceptions and responses, this research investigates how a model's body pose in an image affects social media engagement. We introduce two body pose-related metrics, expansiveness and form, using machine learning and estimate their effects on social media engagement through empirical analysis and a lab experiment. We find that pose expansiveness (i.e., how much space the pose takes up) and sitting (vs. naturally standing) pose have positive effects on social media engagement. Our findings bring an interesting insight that marketers can enhance consumer engagement without extra cost by adjusting model's pose.

  Have you ever walked into a store during regular hours, only to find it unexpectedly closed? Or waited in line at a restaurant, only to hear they've run out of ingredients? While most retailers strive to meet consumer demand, some deliberately introduce uncertainty in product availability and make the availability information unpredictable prior to a visit — a phenomenon we call 'unpredictable marketing.' This research project seeks to explain this seemingly irrational behavior of retailers. Through analytical modeling, we find that unpredictable marketing can signal good quality when product availability falls within an intermediate range and search cost is sufficiently low relative to the product utility. Specifically, it is better-off for high-quality firm to credibly signal its good quality through unpredictable marketing at the cost of losing some demand because there are sufficient consumers who highly value the high-quality product enought to tolerate unpredictability. The low-quality firm, on the other hand, cannot mimic this strategy because few customers would risk unpredictability for the low-quality product. Our findings suggest that unpredictable marketing can be an effective strategy under specific conditions despite the risk of missing out on some demands.
