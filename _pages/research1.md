# The Body Speaks: the Effects of Machine-Extracted Body Pose in Image Contents

---
**Abstract** The human body plays a vital role in nonverbal communication. However, previous literature on human images on social media has primarily focused on the mere presence of humans or their facial characteristics. Only a few studies have closely examined the human body pose, likely due to its complexity and unstructured nature. In this work, the authors introduce and quantify two body pose-related metricsâ€”expansiveness (i.e., the space the body posture takes up) and form (e.g., standing, sitting) using advanced computer vision techniques and deep clustering. Utilizing a large fashion image database, the authors demonstrate how the proposed metrics systematically relate to each other and impact social media engagement proxied by accrued likes. They find that expansiveness and sitting (vs. naturally standing) pose have significant and robust main effects on social media engagement. A lab experiment extends the positive impact of expansiveness beyond social media engagement through &#x2019;likes&#x2019; to social media engagement through &#x2019;comments&#x2019; and purchase intention toward the depicted product. Dynamic imagery and enhanced aesthetics evaluation are suggested as the underlying drivers of the positive effects of expansiveness. Collectively, these results demonstrate how marketers can enhance social media engagement and purchase intention by manipulating a model&#x2019;s pose.
