# Analysis of New Market Structure Using Text Mining and Consumer Perceptions Map: The Case of the Korean Craft Beer Market

---
  
Purpose This paper aims to effectively utilize user-generated content (UGC) and analyze the market structure of a relatively new market which lacks rich user review information. Specifically, we propose a domain-specific text mining tool for the domestic craft beer market and visualize the market structure by incorporating how individual beer products are positioned in the perceptual map of consumers.

Design/methodology/approach We collect user review information from Naver blogs, and extract words that describe beers. We identify semantic relationships between beer products through text mining, and then depending on these semantic relationships, construct a graph representing the market structure of the domestic craft beer market based on the consumer's perceptual map.

Findings First, beer products produced in the same brewery are perceived as very similar to consumers. Second, only two products, ‘Heukdang Milky Stout’ and ‘Gompyo’, was noticeably distinguishable from other products. Third, even though ‘Gyeongbokgung’ is from a different brewery, it is located very close to the products of ‘Jeju Beer’ brewery such as ‘Jeju Baeknokdam Ale’ and ‘Seongsan Ilchulbong Ale’, which suggests the influence of ‘landmark series.’ We successfully show that our methodology effectively describes the market structure of the craft beer market.
