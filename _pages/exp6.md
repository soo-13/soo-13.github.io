- Believing that data scientists need to communicate well, I held free lectures for beginners to deliver knowledge about stocks in front of people we didn't know, in order to practice presentation.
- I hypothesized that "people who applied for seminars/lectures frequently in the past are less likely to confirm their attendance at lectures." I analyzed the past application history of lecture applicants using data from "On-Off Mix."
- Although it was not big data, I wanted to analyze the data I had, and  I concluded that I needed to charge for venue rental fees to reduce no-shows.
