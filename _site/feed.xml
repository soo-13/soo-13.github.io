<hr />
<p>This was an opportunity to explore various fields such as AI Architecture, AI Embedded System, Image/Video AI, NLP/Voice AI, and more. I was a team leader, worked on a project under the team name ‘DeepTree’, where we used Object Detection and calculation formulas to extract features from the HTP (House/Tree/Person) test, a psychological test for children’s art, in order to assist art psychotherapists in making judgments. Our goal was to make it easier for children to approach art therapy. In fact, one of the team members wanted to start a business based on this idea, so this research was even more worthwhile to pursue. We received 1st Prize during the AI Business Model Course.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yeonsoo Lee</name><email>smileystar@kaist.ac.kr</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
